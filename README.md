# BIOS Assembly Program

This project involves creating an assembly program that runs directly from the BIOS, prints "Hello, World!", creates a text file, calculates its hash, and displays the hash. This requires understanding several advanced topics in low-level programming and system architecture.

## Steps to Achieve Your Goal

### Understanding BIOS Programming and Bootloaders

1. **BIOS Basics**: Learn how the BIOS works, its interrupt services, and how it loads the bootloader.
2. **Bootloader Development**: Understand how to create a basic bootloader that can load and execute a binary program.

### 16-bit x86 Assembly Language

1. **Learning Assembly**: Study 16-bit x86 assembly language, including instruction sets, registers, memory addressing, and BIOS interrupts.
2. **Writing Assembly Code**: Practice writing simple assembly programs that use BIOS interrupts for basic I/O operations.

### Creating Bootable Images

1. **Creating Binary Files**: Learn how to assemble and link assembly programs into binary executables.
2. **Creating Bootable USB/ISO**: Understand how to create bootable disk images (USB or ISO) from binary files.

### File I/O Operations in Low-Level Code

1. **File Systems**: Understand file system structures (like FAT) that can be accessed without an OS.
2. **Direct Disk Access**: Learn how to perform direct disk access using BIOS interrupts to read and write files.

### TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Basics

1. **TPM Overview**: Study the TPM architecture and its features.
2. **TPM Programming**: Learn how to interact with TPM hardware using its command set, specifically for hashing operations.

### Hash Algorithms and Implementation

1. **Hash Functions**: Understand how hash functions (like SHA-256) work.
2. **Implementing Hash Functions**: Learn how to implement or use existing hash functions in low-level code.

## Learning Resources

### Books and Tutorials

- **"Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett**: An excellent introduction to x86 assembly language.
- **"The Art of Assembly Language" by Randall Hyde**: A comprehensive guide to assembly language programming.
- **"Operating Systems: From 0 to 1" by Tuomo Valkonen**: Explains how to write a simple operating system, which includes bootloader development.

### Online Courses and Documentation

- **Udemy/Coursera**: Courses on x86 assembly language and low-level programming.
- **OSDev Wiki**: A valuable resource for operating system development, including bootloaders and BIOS programming.
- **Intel Manuals**: Official documentation on x86 architecture and instruction sets.

### Open-Source Projects

- **Bootloaders**: Study simple open-source bootloader projects like GRUB or other minimal bootloaders.
- **TPM Libraries**: Look at open-source TPM libraries and projects to understand how they interact with TPM hardware.

## Practical Steps

### Set Up Development Environment

- Install an assembler (like NASM) and a toolchain for creating bootable images.
- Use emulators like QEMU to test your bootloader and assembly code.

### Write and Test Simple Programs

- Start with simple programs that print text using BIOS interrupts.
- Gradually add complexity by writing programs that read from and write to disk.

### Develop Bootloader and BIOS Program

- Create a simple bootloader that loads your assembly program.
- Extend the program to create a text file (if feasible) and calculate its hash.

### Learn and Implement TPM Interaction

- Study the TPM command set and write code to perform hashing operations.
- Integrate the TPM interaction code with your BIOS program.

### Debug and Optimize

- Use debugging tools to step through your assembly code and fix issues.
- Optimize the code for size and performance, ensuring it fits within the constraints of a bootable image.
